# Output Weighted training algorithm for detecting anomalies, rare and extreme events
### Custom output weighted training algorithms to detect anomalies, outliers, rare and extreme events in regression and forcasting problems.

The code "OW_regression.py" icludes a quick demo implementing the algorithms in a simple regression problem via a deep neural network.

The code "OW_SDE_forecast.py" icludes a quick demo implementing the algorithms in forecasting a stochastic time series via a deep neural network.

For simplicity of access, all the custom training codes are included in both demo codes.
